(ns clojure2d.core
  "Main Clojure2d entry point for Canvas, Window and drawing generatively.

  Basic concepts:

  * Image - `BufferedImage` java object used to store ARGB color information.
  * Canvas - Image which contains graphical context. You draw on it. Similar to processing Graphics object.
  * Window - Window which can display canvas, process events, keeps app/script concept. Similar to Processing sketch with display.
  * Events - Mouse and keyboard events

  Protocols:

  * [[ImageProto]] - basic Image operations (Image, Canvas, Window and Pixels (see [[clojure2d.pixels]]) implement this protocol.
  * Various events protocols. Events and Window implement these:
      * [[MouseXYProto]] - mouse position related to Window.
      * [[MouseButtonProto]] - status of mouse buttons.
      * [[KeyEventProto]] - keyboard status
      * [[ModifiersProto]] - status of special keys (Ctrl, Meta, Alt, etc.)
  * Additionally Window implements [[PressedProto]] in case you want to check in draw loop if your mouse or key is pressed.

  ## Image

  Image is `BufferedImage` java object. Image can be read from file using [[load-image]] function or saved to file with [[save]]. ImageProto provides [[get-image]] function to access to Image object directly (if you need)
  There is no function which creates Image directly (use Canvas instead).

  ### SVG

  To load SVG use `load-svg` which creates internal Batik object. Object can be rendered to Image with `transcode-svg`.
  
  ## Canvas

  Canvas is an object which is used to draw on it. To create new one call [[canvas]] function. Provide width and height and optionally quality hint.

  Quality hints are as follows:

  * `:low` - no antialiasing, speed optimized rendering
  * `:mid` - antialiasing, speed optimized rendering
  * `:high` - antialiasing, quality optimized rendering (default)
  * `:highest` - as `:high` plus `PURE_STROKE` hint, which can give strange results in some cases.

  To draw on Canvas you have to create graphical context. Wrap your code into one of two functions:

  * [[with-canvas]] - binding macro `(with-canvas [local-canvas canvas-object] ...)`
  * [[with-canvas->]] - threading macro `(with-canvas-> canvas ...)`.

  Each function in this macro has to accept Canvas as first parameter and return Canvas.

  Canvas bound to Window and accessed via callback drawing function (a'ka Processing `draw()`) has graphical context created automatically.
  
  ## Events

  Java2d keyboard and mouse event handlers can be defined as custom multimethods separately for each window.
  There are following options:

  * Handlers for particular key with dispatch as a vector of window name and key character (eg. `[\"name\" \\c]`)
      * [[key-pressed]] - when key is pressed
      * [[key-released]] - when key is released
      * [[key-typed]] - when key is typed
  * Handler for given key event with dispatch as a vector of window name and key event (eg. `[\"name\" :key-pressed]`)
  * Handler for mouse event with dispatch as a vector of window name and mouse event (eg. `[\"name\" :mouse-dragged]`)

  Every event handler accepts as parameters:

  * Event object (java KeyEvent or MouseEvent) - access to the fields through defined protocols
  * Global state - state attached to window

  Event handler should return new global state.
  
  ## Window

  Window object is responsible for displaying canvas content and processing events. You can also initialize states here.

  To create window and display it call [[show-window]]. Function accepts several parameters which are described below.

  Window itself simulates workflow which is available in Processing/Quil frameworks.
  
  ### Internals

  When window is created following things are done:

  1. Check parameters and create missing values for missed ones.
  2. If `:setup` function is provided, call it and use returned value as `:draw-state`
  3. Create JFrame, java.awt.Canvas, pack them, attach event handlers and display
  4. Set global state
  5. Run separated thread which refreshes display with given `:fps`, if `:draw-fn` is available it's called before refreshment.

  Additional informations:

  * Display refreshment is done by displaying canvas on JFrame. You can set separate quality hints (same as for canvas) for this process with `:hint` parameter.
  * When you privide drawing function, it's called every refreshment. By default graphical context is created every call - which costs time but is safe in case you want to directly access pixels. The second variant which can be used is to create graphical context once at the moment of window creation. This variant can be forced by setting `:refresher` parameter to `:fast`.
  * You can replace canvas attached to window with [[replace-canvas]] function.
  * Window itself acts as event object (implements all event protocols)
  * Canvas and window can have different sizes. Display refreshing functions will scale up/down in such case.
  * Events and refreshment are not synchronized. Try to avoid drawing inside event multimethods.
  * You can create as many windows as you want.
  * You can check if window is visible or not with [[window-active?]] function.
  * If you provide both `:draw-state` and `:setup`. Value returned by `:setup` has a precedence unless is `nil` or `false`.
   
  ### Parameters

  Following parameters are used:

  * `:canvas` - canvas which is displayed on window. Default is 200x200px
  * `:window-name` - name of the window as a string. Used for event multimathods dispatch.
  * `:w` - width of the window. Default width of the canvas
  * `:h` - height of the window. Default height of the canvas
  * `:fps` - frames per second, defaults to 60
  * `:draw-fn` - drawing function, called before every display refreshment. Function should accept following four parameters:
      * canvas within graphical context (you don't need to use [[with-canvas]] or [[with-canvas->]] wrappers.
      * window object
      * current frame number as a long value
      * current state
  * `:setup` - setup function which should accept two parameters and return initial draw state.
      * canvas withing graphical context
      * window object
  * `:state` - initial global state
  * `:draw-state` - initial local (drawing) state. If `setup` is provided, value returned by it will be used instead.
  * `:hint` - display quality hint. Use it when window and canvas have different sizes
  * `:refresher` - when create graphical context for draw: `:fast` for once or `:safe` for each call (default).

  ## States

  There are two states managed by library: global state connected to window and draw state connected to callback drawing function.

  ### Global state

  Each window has its own state kept in `atom`. The main idea is to have data which flow between event calls. Every event function accepts state and should return state data.
  Initial state can be set with [[show-window]] `:state` parameter 
  To access current state from outside the flow call [[get-state]]. You can also mutate the state with [[set-state!]].

  ### Local state for drawing function

  When drawing callback is used you can keep state between calls. What is returned by callback is passed as a parameter in next call. Drawing function is not synchronized with events that's why local state is introduced. You can still access and change global state.

  You can init state from [[show-window]] with `:draw-state` or `:setup` parameters.

  ## How to draw

  There are plenty of functions which you can use to draw on canvas. They can be grouped to:

  * Primitives like [[point]], [[rect]], etc.
  * Tranformations like [[translate]], [[rotate]], etc.
  * Text rendering like [[text]], [[set-font-attributes]], etc.
  * Image manipulations like [[convolve]]
  * Color and style like [[set-color]], [[gradient-mode]], [[set-background]], [[set-stroke]],  etc.

  All operate on canvas and return canvas as a result. Obviously canvas is mutated.
  
  ## Session

  Session is a datetime with its hash kept globally in vector. To access current session names call [[session-name]].

  Following functions rely on session:

  * [[next-filename]] - generate unique filename based on session
  * [[log]] - save any information to the file under name based on session. See [[log-name]].

  Session is created automatically when needed. Session management functions are:

  * [[make-session]] - create new session
  * [[ensure-session]] - create new session when there is no one
  * [[close-session]] - close current session
  * [[session-name]] - returns current session.

  Additional utility functions
  
  * date and time functions
  * [[to-hex]] formatter"
