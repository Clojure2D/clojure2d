# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This change log follows the conventions of [keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## 1.2.0

### Added

* `:always-on-top?` parameter to set window to be on top
* `orient-canvas` - axis orientation functions
* `filter-channel`, `filter-channel-xy`, `blend-channel` and `blend-channel-xy` can accept function as a parameter single parameter (acts a partial)..
* `set-composite` and `composite` to compose drawing with canvas by Java2d, see java.awt.Composite
* new window parameter, `:background` set panel background color

### Changed

* BREAKING: by default canvas is fully transparent. Window background is set to white. This is made to match html canvas behaviour.
* BREAKING: `set-background` uses SrcOver (default) composite. Previously was Src.

* grid cells
* hex primitive

### Changed

## 1.0.3

### Added
* reconstruction filters spread parameter

## 1.0.2

### Added

* `pack` color into 32 bit integer
* `resize` Pixels

## 0.0.7

### Added

- `with-canvas` is no longer threading macro (use `with-canvas->` for that)
- `:setup` parameter added to `show-window`. It's run before displaying window. Parameters are: canvas (within context) and window. When returned value is not `nil` it's used as initial state. In other case `:draw-state` parameter is used.
- color can be represented as int (eg. in hex form like: 0x234344)
- `clamp255` returns double, for long version call `lclamp255`
- bezier and curve functions added
- date/time functions (year, month, day, hour, minute, sec, millis, nanos)
- new function `filled-with-stroke` - to draw primitive with stroke and filled
- `load-bytes` added
- general key-event added (like mouse-event). You can now dispatch also on event type not only key char or code
- background supports transparency
- screen-width and screen-height functions

### Fixed

- threshold filter wrong values
- `draw` now displays exception when something is wrong
- window canvas was in the bad size causing visual artifacts
- more accurate frame delay calculations

### Changed

- `with-canvas` is renamed to `with-canvas->`
- `:highest` hint added (it's `:high` with Stroke Pure)
- :right, :left or :center alignments for text (last parameter, default :left)
- `rendering-hints` is map of vectors now, it gave 25% speed gain during recreating graphics context
