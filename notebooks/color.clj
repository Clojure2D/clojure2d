;; # clojure2d.color namespace

;; `clojure2d.color` namespace for Clojure is a rich collection of functions for various color, palettes and grandents manipulations. Including:
;;
;; * various color representations
;; * color spaces coversions
;; * palettes and gradients
;; * distances
;; * blending

;; I use `ðŸŽ¨` internal function to render given color, palette or gradient.

;; # Intro

;; There are three entities we will deal with:

;; * `color` - representation of the single color with 3 color information channels and additional alpha channel (4 in total).

(ðŸŽ¨ :darkcyan)
(ðŸŽ¨ (c/color :cyan))

;; * `palette` - vector of colors

(ðŸŽ¨ [:docc/dark-tyrian-blue :blue [200 200 255] "#f" (c/set-alpha "#a" 100)])
(ðŸŽ¨ (c/palette [:green :lime :yellow]))

;; * `gradient` - continuous interpolation between colors, returning a color for given value from `0.0` to `1.0`

(def yb-gradient (c/gradient [:yellow :blue]))
(yb-gradient 0.3)
(ðŸŽ¨ yb-gradient)

;; # Color

;; At the beginning let's start with a `color`. A color is always a vector containing 3 channels from given color space plus one additional to describe opacity, ie. alpha channel.
;;
;; By default Java and WWW apps interpret a color as a *sRGB*. In `clojure2d.color` value of each channel in *sRGB* color space is from `[0.0-255.0]` range. Other color spaces defined here can operate on different ranges. More about this later.

;; ## Color representation

;; Internally a color is represented as `fastmath.vector.Vec4` type but we can use any other representation which eventually is coerced to a `Vec4`. Let's look at all of the possible options. 

;; ### Named color

;; The quickest option is to use a keyword as a color name, there are two groups of names.
;;
;; The full list of names can be found [here](https://clojure2d.github.io/clojure2d/docs/static/colors.html) or retrieved by calling:

(sort (c/named-colors-list))

;; #### HTML color names

;; All basic and extended colors used by modern browsers as a lower-case keyword. Note that some colors can have two similar names. For example `:darkblue` and `:dark-blue` represent the same color.

(ðŸŽ¨ :darkblue :dark-blue)

;; #### Dictionary of Colour Combinations

;; This is the list of colors compiled in the book ["A Dictionary of Colour Combinations"](https://en.seigensha.com/books/978-4-86152-247-5/) by Sanzo Wada, digitalized by [Dain M. Blodorn Kim](https://github.com/dblodorn/sanzo-wada/) and eventually corrected and published by [Matt DesLauriers](https://github.com/mattdesl/dictionary-of-colour-combinations).
;;
;; Colors from this resource are prefixed by a `:docc/` namespace.

(ðŸŽ¨ :docc/burnt-sienna :docc/peacock-blue :docc/light-pinkish-cinnamon)

;; ### CSS string

;; The other representation is based on CSS. A hexadecimal string in one of the following forms: `#X`, `#XX`, `#RGB`, `#RRGGBB` or `#RRGGBBAA`. Where `X` (`[0-F]`) or `XX` (`[00-FF]`) are the grey values. The hash character is optional, lower case also can be used.

(ðŸŽ¨ "#7" "#4a" "#FA3" "#FFAA33AA" "f1a130")

;; To convert any color to CSS representation call:

(clerk/table
 (map (juxt identity c/format-hex) [:red 0xaa112299 [123 44 55]
                                    java.awt.Color/YELLOW
                                    "ab"]))

;; ### Integer

;; Any integer (32bit number) is interpreted as a color, where 8 most significant bits represent alpha channel, next 8 bits, first channel, and so on: `0xAARRGGBB`

(ðŸŽ¨ 0x91aa0000 ; with alpha set to 0x91
    255
    -256)

;; Note that 0x00rrggbb is the same as 0xffrrggbb, so you can't represent fully transparent color with an integer.

[(c/color 0x123456)
 (c/color 0x00123456)
 (c/color 0xff123456)]

;; conversion to an integer is possible with `pack` function

(c/pack [22 33 44 55])

;; ### Any `Sequable`

;; Any Clojure `Sequable` is coerced to a color with the following rules. Color channel value can be any number type (int or double). Numbers are rounded to the nearest integer and clamped to have [0-255] range.
;;
;; Rules are:
;;
;; * 1-element sequence is treated as a `grey`
;; * 2-element sequence is a `gray` with `alpha`
;; * 3-element sequence is `red`, `green` and `blue`
;; Finally, 4+-element sequence is treated as *RGBA*, any additional sequence elements are ignored

(ðŸŽ¨ [129]
    (list 140.11 255/3)
    (seq (java.util.ArrayList. [240 220 20]))
    [129 190 222 230 1 2 3 4])

;; ### Fastmath vectors

;; Fastmath vectors `Vec2`, `Vec3` and `Vec4` are treated as a `Sequable`

(ðŸŽ¨ (v/vec2 12 200)
    (v/vec3 12 99 200)
    (v/vec4 12 99 122 200))

;; ### AWT Color

;; For interoperability we can use also AWT color (`java.awt.Color` class).

(ðŸŽ¨ (java.awt.Color. 120 33 99)
    (java.awt.Color. 0.9 0.2 0.4)
    (java.awt.Color/PINK))

;; ### Coercions

;; Any color representation is implicitely coerced to a `fastmath.vector.Vec4` type. You can make explicit coercion with `to-color` and `color` function. The latter can construct a color from channel values. Additionally `gray` function returns gray color (with optional alpha)

(class (c/to-color :green))
(map c/to-color [:red 0xffaa33 "fa4" [1 2 3 4]])
(ðŸŽ¨ (c/color :red 200)
    (c/color 12 33 99)
    (c/color 12 33 99 200)
    (c/gray 99))

;; You can also convert to AWT Color, integer and - as previously mentioned - to a CSS Color

^{::clerk/viewer :block}
[(c/awt-color :pink)
 (c/awt-gray 123)
 (c/format-hex :pink)
 (c/pack :pink)]

;; ### Color validation

;; To check if color is valid or invalid. You can use two functions: `possible-color?` and `valid-color?`. Former function uses some logic to determine if the imput is color or not, Latter one, just tries to coerce to a color and catches exception when it's not (returning `false` in such case).

[(c/possible-color? [11 22 33]) (c/valid-color? [11 22 33])]
[(c/possible-color? [:a]) (c/valid-color? [:a])]

;; There are also tests if color is black or not

(c/black? :black)
(c/not-black? :black)

;; ## Getting and setting channels

;; ### Setting channels

;; To modify given channel of the color use one of the following:
;;
;; * `set-red` or `set-ch0` - to modify first channel
;; * `set-green` or `set-ch1`- to modify second channel
;; * `set-blue` or `set-ch2` - to modify third one
;; * `set-alpha` or call `(color any-color alpha)` - to modify alpha channel
;; * `set-channel` - sets selected channel (optionally for given color space)

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/set-green :red 200)
    (c/set-alpha :red 200)
    (c/color :red 200)
    (c/set-channel :red :HSL 0 300.0))

;; ### Getting channels

;; To access given channel call:

;; * `red` or `ch0` - to get first channel
;; * `green` or `ch1` - to get second channel
;; * `blue` or `ch2` - to get third channel
;; * `alpha` - to get alpha channel
;; * `get-channel` - to get selected channel (optionally for given color space)

(ðŸŽ¨ :docc/fawn)
((juxt c/red c/green c/blue c/alpha) :docc/fawn)
(c/get-channel :red :HSL 2)

;; #### Getting Luma and Hue

;; There is a set of functions returning additional color information, these are:

;; * `luma` - information about luma (brightness) of the color, `[0.0-255.0]`
;; * `relative-luma` - luma from linear RGB, `[0.0-255.0]`
;; * `hue` - hue value, hexagon projection, `[0.0-360.0]`
;; * `hue-polar` - hue value, polar projection, `[0.0-360.0]`,
;; * `hue-paletton` - hue value, as it is used in [paletton](https://paletton.com/), `[0.0-360.0]`

(ðŸŽ¨ :docc/buffy-citrine)
((juxt c/luma c/relative-luma c/hue c/hue-polar c/hue-paletton) :docc/buffy-citrine)

;; #### Clamping

;; To ensure our *sRGB* color is within the range we can use `clamp` which constrains values to a `[0.0-255.0]` range and `lclamp` which also round channel values to the nearest integer.

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/clamp [-23.3 123.033 293.33])
    (c/lclamp [-23.3 123.033 293.33]))

;; ## Color comparison and distances

;; This part describes a number of color comparison and distance/difference functions. Most of them are based mainly on CIE delta-E* definitions:

;; * `delta-E*` - ${\Delta}E^*_{ab}$, CIE76 difference, euclidean distance in LAB color space
;; * `delta-C*` - ${\Delta}C^*_{ab}$, chroma (color) difference in LAB color space, CIE76
;; * `delta-H*` - ${\Delta}H^*_{ab}$, hue difference in LAB color space, CIE76
;; * `delta-E*-94` - ${\Delta}E^*_{94}$, CIE94 difference
;; * `delta-E*-2000` - ${\Delta}E^*_{00}$, CIEDE2000 difference, three optional weights can be provided, `l` for luma, `c` for color intensity and `h` for hue. By default they are set to `1.0`.
;; * `delta-E*-CMC` - ${\Delta}E^*_{CMC}$, CMC l:c 1984 difference, two optional weights can be provided, `l` for luma and `c` for color intensity. By default they are set to `1.0`.
;; * `delta-E-z` - ${\Delta}E_{z}$, difference in JzAzBz color space
;; * `delta-E-HyAB` - ${\Delta}E_{HyAB}$, hybrid difference in LAB color space
;; * `delta-E*-euclidean` - general, euclidean, distance in selected color space (`Oklab` by default)
;; * `delta-C-RGB` - ${\Delta}C$, difference in RGB color space ("redmean")
;; * `delta-D-HCL` - ${\Delta}D_{HCL}$, difference in HCL (Sarifuddin and Missaou) color space

;; There are two more measures: `contrast-ratio` from WCAG (the value below 3.0 means that contrast is too low) and `noticable-different?` to check if colors are visually different, as described in this [paper](https://research.tableau.com/sites/default/files/2014CIC_48_Stone_v3.pdf).

;; ## Color space conversions

;; Color can be converted to and from various of different than `sRGB` color spaces. Full list of possible color spaces is defined under `colorspaces-list` variable.

c/colorspaces-list

;; All color space converters are defined as a functions with names `to-XXX` and `from-XXX`, where `XXX` is the name of the color space. All color spaces a fully reversible, which means that converting to and from given color space yields approximately initial color.

(c/from-YDbDr (c/to-YDbDr [100 200 43]))

;; Due to the fact, that each color space has its own ranges for each channel, there are normalized versions of converters. The names of the functions end with the `*`. Normalization is linear in most cases (exception: `OSA`)

(c/to-LAB :yellow)

;; Normalized color spaces are also reversible:

;; ## Mixing and blending

;; Colors can be mixed and blended in various ways. Let's start with linear interpoation. By default `lerp` finds mid colour. 

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/lerp :orange :blue))

;; But we can decide about the amount of interpolation

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/lerp :orange :blue 0.25)
    (c/lerp :orange :blue 0.75))

;; Another two functions `lerp+` and `lerp-` are trying to conserve brightness of the right or left color.

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/lerp- :orange :blue 0.3)
    (c/lerp+ :orange :blue 0.7))

;; Brightness (Luma) is taken from the first channel of *LAB* color space.

^{::clerk/viewer :block}
[(c/get-channel :blue :LAB 0)
 (c/get-channel (c/lerp+ :orange :blue 0.7) :LAB 0)
 (c/get-channel :orange :LAB 0)
 (c/get-channel (c/lerp- :orange :blue 0.3) :LAB 0)]

;; There also two other methods of mixing: `mix` and `mixsub`. The former one mixes squared values (and takes square root after all), the latter perform subtractive mixing.

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/mix :orange :blue)
    (c/mixsub :orange :blue))

;; We can also lerp and mix in different color spaces
(ðŸŽ¨ (c/lerp :orange :blue :Oklab 0.5)
    (c/mix :orange :blue :Oklab 0.5))

;; To compare above methods let's check gradients generated by them:

(ðŸŽ¨ (partial c/lerp :orange :blue)
    (partial c/lerp :orange :blue :Oklab)
    (partial c/lerp- :orange :blue)
    (partial c/lerp+ :orange :blue)
    (partial c/mix :orange :blue)
    (partial c/mix :orange :blue :Oklab)
    (partial c/mixsub :orange :blue)
    (partial c/mixsub :orange :blue :Oklab))

;; Last method calculates average colors.

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/average [:orange :blue :green :yellow]))

;; We can also average with weights

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/weighted-average [:orange :blue :green :yellow] [1 0.5 1 5]))

;; Additionally we can average in different color spaces:

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/average [:orange :blue :green :yellow] :LAB)
    (c/weighted-average [:orange :blue :green :yellow] [1 0.5 1 5] :LUV))

;; ## Alterations

;; There is a collection of functions which help to alter color characteristics like brightness, saturation, hue, etc. We can also change temperature or tint with other color. We can also build and use `feColorMatrix`.

;; Alterations can be used to alter palettes and gradients.

;; ### Modulation / adjustment

;; Multiplicative or additive operations on channels

;; #### Modulate

;; First option is to use `modulate` function, which multiplies selected channel by a value. Additionally you can choose color space to operate in.

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/modulate :red 0 0.5) ;; Divide red channel by 2
    :maroon ;; Make `:maroon` brighter and less saturated
    (-> :maroon
        (c/modulate :HSL 2 2.0) ; change L channel
        (c/modulate :HSL 1 0.5) ; change S channel
        )) 

;; Let's modulate a palette and gradient

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/palette :category10)
    ;; darken by changing L channel in LAB color space
    (mapv #(c/modulate % :LAB 0 0.5) (c/palette :category10)))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/gradient :warm)
    ;; saturate in LCH color space
    (comp #(c/modulate % :LCH 1 2.0) (c/gradient :warm)))

;; #### Adjust

;; Similarly works `adjust`, the only difference is that it adds a value to a channel.

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/adjust :red 1 127.0)
    ;; Rotate hue 60deg in *HSV* color space
    (c/adjust :red :HSV 0 60.0))

;; The same for palette and gradient

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/palette :category10)
    ;; darken by changing a blackness in HWB color space
    (mapv #(c/adjust % :HWB 2 0.5) (c/palette :category10)))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/gradient :warm)
    ;; rotate hue 60deg
    (comp #(c/adjust % :HSB 0 60.0) (c/gradient :warm)))

;; ### Saturation and brightness

;; Another group of function changes saturation and brightness directly, use:

;; * `saturate` and `desaturate` to change color saturation (it's done in *LCH* color space)
;; * `brighten` and `darken` to change luma (it's done in *LAB* color space)

;; ##### Saturation / desaturation

(ðŸŽ¨ :lightblue
    (c/saturate :lightblue)
    (c/saturate :lightblue 2.0)
    (c/desaturate :lightblue 0.5)
    (c/desaturate :lightblue))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/palette :purple-gray-6)
    (mapv c/saturate (c/palette :purple-gray-6))
    (mapv c/desaturate (c/palette :purple-gray-6)))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/gradient :cool)
    (comp c/saturate (c/gradient :cool))
    (comp c/desaturate (c/gradient :cool)))

;; ##### Brighten / darken

(ðŸŽ¨ :lightblue
    (c/brighten :lightblue)
    (c/brighten :lightblue 2.0)
    (c/darken :lightblue)
    (c/darken :lightblue 2.0))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/palette :purple-gray-6)
    (mapv c/brighten (c/palette :purple-gray-6))
    (mapv c/darken (c/palette :purple-gray-6)))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/gradient :cool)
    (comp c/brighten (c/gradient :cool))
    (comp c/darken (c/gradient :cool)))

;; ### Temperature

;; Adjusting a temperature can make a color warmer or cooler. You can use a temperature name or actual temperature in Kelvins. Additionally we can specify an amount (default: 0.35) of adjustment.
;; Named temperatures are:

c/temperature-names

;; `temperature` function returns a color connected to a given temperature.
(ðŸŽ¨ (c/temperature 10000))

;; Let's see how temperature gradient looks like (from 0K to 30000K):

(ðŸŽ¨ (comp c/temperature (partial * 30000.0)))

;; and finally let's adjust color,

(ðŸŽ¨ :pink
    (c/adjust-temperature :pink :candle)
    (c/adjust-temperature :pink :candle 0.75)
    (c/adjust-temperature :pink :cool)
    (c/adjust-temperature :pink :cool 0.75)
    (c/adjust-temperature :pink 3800))

;; palette,

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/palette :summer)
    (mapv #(c/adjust-temperature % 1000) (c/palette :summer))
    (mapv #(c/adjust-temperature % 30000) (c/palette :summer)))

;; and gradient

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/gradient :cw_2/cw2-079)
    (comp #(c/adjust-temperature % 1000) (c/gradient :cw_2/cw2-079))
    (comp #(c/adjust-temperature % 30000) (c/gradient :cw_2/cw2-079)))

;; ### Tinting

;; We can also change a color towards the value of other color (or palette/gradient). To make it create a `tinter` which is a function changing color to a selected one. It works by multiplying color values, so works well for lighter colors. Let's make tinter which makes colors greener and more yellowish.

(def greener (c/tinter [50 255 50]))
(def yellowish (c/tinter [255 255 50]))
(def reddish (c/tinter [200 50 60]))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/color :lightblue)
    (greener :lightblue)
    (yellowish :lightblue)
    (reddish :lightblue)
    (greener :gray)
    (yellowish :gray)
    (reddish :gray))

;; Dark, or colors with channels near to zero, are more problematic. Next chapter (about mixing) can help to find better way for tinting.

(ðŸŽ¨ (greener :red)
    (yellowish :red)
    (reddish :red))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/palette :beyonce/X47)
    (mapv yellowish (c/palette :beyonce/X47))
    (mapv greener (c/palette :beyonce/X47))
    (mapv reddish (c/palette :beyonce/X47)))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/gradient :ma_xmas/xmas_01)
    (comp yellowish (c/gradient :ma_xmas/xmas_01))
    (comp greener (c/gradient :ma_xmas/xmas_01))
    (comp reddish (c/gradient :ma_xmas/xmas_01)))

;; ### Matrix operations

;; SVG's [feColorMatrix](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/feColorMatrix) allows another way to alter a color. We can use several predefined and commonly used operators. Matrices operate on `sRGB` color space.

;; #### Contrast

(def contrast-15 (c/contrast 1.5))
(def contrast-075 (c/contrast 0.75))

(ðŸŽ¨ :orange
    (contrast-15 :orange)
    (contrast-075 :orange))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/palette :njgs/njaquif)
    (mapv contrast-15 (c/palette :njgs/njaquif))
    (mapv contrast-075 (c/palette :njgs/njaquif)))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold)
    (comp contrast-15 (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold))
    (comp contrast-075 (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold)))

;; #### Exposure

;; Multiplicative adjustment of the channel values. This is the same as CSS `brightness`.

(def exposure-125 (c/exposure 1.25))
(def exposure-075 (c/exposure 0.75))

(ðŸŽ¨ :orange
    (exposure-125 :orange)
    (exposure-075 :orange))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/palette :njgs/njaquif)
    (mapv exposure-125 (c/palette :njgs/njaquif))
    (mapv exposure-075 (c/palette :njgs/njaquif)))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold)
    (comp exposure-125 (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold))
    (comp exposure-075 (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold)))

;; #### Brightness

;; Additive adjustment of the channel values. Argument `0` means no change. `1.0` adds `255`, `-1.0` subracts `255`.

(def brightness-+02 (c/brightness 0.2))
(def brightness--02 (c/brightness -0.2))

(ðŸŽ¨ :orange
    (brightness-+02 :orange)
    (brightness--02 :orange))

    (mapv brightness-+02 (c/palette :njgs/njaquif))
    (mapv brightness--02 (c/palette :njgs/njaquif)))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold)
    (comp brightness-+02 (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold))
    (comp brightness--02 (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold)))

;; #### Saturation

(def saturation-15 (c/saturation 1.5))
(def saturation-075 (c/saturation 0.75))

(ðŸŽ¨ :orange
    (saturation-15 :orange)
    (saturation-075 :orange))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/palette :njgs/njaquif)
    (mapv saturation-15 (c/palette :njgs/njaquif))
    (mapv saturation-075 (c/palette :njgs/njaquif)))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold)
    (comp saturation-15 (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold))
    (comp saturation-075 (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold)))

;; #### Grayscale

;; Desaturates a color, `(grayscale 1.0)` creates grays

(def grayscale-05 (c/grayscale 0.5))
(def grayscale-1 (c/grayscale 1.0))

(ðŸŽ¨ :orange
    (grayscale-05 :orange)
    (grayscale-1 :orange))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/palette :njgs/njaquif)
    (mapv grayscale-05 (c/palette :njgs/njaquif))

(def sepia-05 (c/sepia 0.5))
(def sepia-1 (c/sepia 1.0))

(ðŸŽ¨ :orange
    (sepia-05 :orange)

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold)
    (comp sepia-05 (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold))
    (comp sepia-1 (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold)))

;; #### Rotate hue

;; Rotates hue with given argument in degrees. Argument can be negative.

(def hue-rotate--60 (c/hue-rotate -60.0))
(def hue-rotate-+60 (c/hue-rotate +60.0))

(ðŸŽ¨ :orange
    (hue-rotate--60 :orange)

    (comp hue-rotate--60 (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold))
    (comp hue-rotate-+60 (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold)))

;; #### Custom matrix

;; We can create a custom color matrix as described in [this article](https://alistapart.com/article/finessing-fecolormatrix/).
;; To construct a matrix operator, call `fe-color-matrix` with a vector of 20 values (row-wise).

(def blue-magenta (c/fe-color-matrix [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0.5 0 0 0 0 1 0]))

(ðŸŽ¨ :orange
    (blue-magenta :orange))

    (mapv blue-magenta (c/palette :njgs/njaquif)))

(ðŸŽ¨ (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold)
    (comp blue-magenta (c/gradient :ggthemes/Green-Gold)))

;; ## Color Vision Deficiency 

;; To simulate how color, palette or gradient looks with given color blidness you can call `cvd-lens` function. There are 8 defined CVDs. Let's simulate CVD with a `rainbow` grandient.

(def rainbow (c/gradient :grDevices/rainbow))

(ðŸŽ¨ rainbow
    (comp c/achromatomaly rainbow)
    (comp c/achromatopsia rainbow)
    (comp c/deuteranomaly rainbow)

    (comp c/protanomaly rainbow)
    (comp c/protanopia rainbow)
    (comp c/tritanomaly rainbow)
    (comp c/tritanopia rainbow))

;; ## Random generators

(ðŸŽ¨ (sort-by c/hue (repeatedly 10 #(c/set-alpha (c/random-color :warm) (r/drand 255))))
